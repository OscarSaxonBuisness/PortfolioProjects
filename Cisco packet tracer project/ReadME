📡 Cisco Packet Tracer Network Design Project
This project showcases a fully functional network infrastructure designed using Cisco Packet Tracer. It demonstrates understanding and application of key networking principles including subnetting, VLAN configuration, routing, and access control.

🧠 Key Features
🖧 Custom Topology: Includes routers, switches, end devices (PCs, printers), and a server.

🔐 VLAN Configuration: Segmenting networks for better security and traffic control.

🌐 Static Routing: Configured to enable communication between different subnets.

🧮 Subnetting: Efficient IP address allocation using subnetting techniques.

🔌 Device Configuration: Each device set up with correct interfaces, IPs, and hostnames.

🧪 Simulation Mode: Used to test data flow, ping responses, and troubleshoot errors.

🗂️ Files
