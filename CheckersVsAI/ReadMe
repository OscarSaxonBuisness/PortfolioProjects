♟️ Checkers vs AI (Python + Tkinter)
This project is a two-player checkers game built using Python's tkinter GUI library, with an AI opponent powered by the Minimax algorithm. It allows the player to move pieces interactively with the mouse, 
while the computer opponent evaluates the board and makes strategic decisions in response.

🧠 How It Works
The game logic includes piece selection, movement, capturing, and turn control.

The AI uses the Minimax algorithm, which simulates multiple future game states to determine the optimal move.
This helps the computer make decisions that minimize the player's chance of winning while maximizing its own advantage.

Piece images are dynamically loaded (black.png and white.png) to render a visually engaging board.

🎮 Controls
Move: Click on a piece, then click the destination square to move it.

Turn-Based: Player vs AI format (one move at a time).
