🎲 Lucky Guess Number Game (C# WinForms)
This is a simple C# Windows Forms game designed to help users practice number comparison, estimation, and intuition. The player attempts to guess a randomly generated number within a specific range.

🧠 Game Concept
The application randomly selects a number, and the player has to guess what it is. After each attempt, the game provides feedback whether the guess was too high or too low. The goal is to guess the correct number in the fewest attempts possible.

💡 Features
Random number generation within a defined range

Multiple forms for game flow (e.g., intro screen, gameplay, and result)

Real-time feedback for user guesses

Win/lose condition handling

Restartable game loop

🖱️ How to Play
Launch the application.

Enter your guess in the input box.

Click the Submit button.

The game will tell you whether your guess is too high, too low, or correct.

Once the number is guessed correctly, the player is shown a result screen with the option to restart.
